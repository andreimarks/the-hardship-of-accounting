2021-03-06-Saturday

Bleh haven't written much at all, however I've been active every market day. Haven't added all that much different to my code yet, though I've continued contributing to the brokerage account. I'd say my past week has covered a handful of different items:
* Experiments with Alpaca's OTO orders and trailing stops.
* Some close calls that will help improve future code.
* Start with some paper trading.
* Seeing some API instability drama on the Alpaca Slack.
* Rough market week.
* Ordered a book.
* Need to switch up how I set up environments.

### OTO Orders and Trailing Stops
