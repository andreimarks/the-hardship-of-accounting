### 2021-02-23-Tuesday

My near term goal is to start with designing and live testing a dumb intraday scalping algorithm. I definitely would like to try with real money, but have a bit of time to get up to the $25k threshold. In the interest of stretching things out and not jumping in right away, I'm planning on building my account slowly up to that limit, over the course of a few weeks. Not going to spend too much time thinking about what I'm actually investing in, I'll just throw a certain amount into some sector ETFs until I have enough for the PDT rules.

And while I'm doing that I'll work on a that scalping algorithm in my paper trading account, do tutorials, collect resources, and read up on things.

Had it in mind to start investing and trading programmatically. Going to try and commit an hour per day. End goal is open, mainly learning (mainly more math, python, and infrastructure) and of course maybe earn a little more money on the side. Seems crazy _not_ to try given my skillset and current life circumstances.

I'm using [Alpaca](http://alpaca.markets) as my broker (it's API first), and currently just slowly dripping money in up to the PDT limit so I can start messing around with scalping. In the meantime doing tutorials and learning more about the finance side of things.
