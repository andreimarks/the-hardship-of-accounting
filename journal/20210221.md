Had it in mind to start investing and trading programmatically. Going to try and commit an hour per day. End goal is open, mainly learning (mainly more math, python, and infrastructure) and of course maybe earn a little more money on the side. Seems crazy _not_ to try given my skillset and current life circumstances.

I'm using [Alpaca](http://alpaca.markets) as my broker (it's API first), and currently just slowly dripping money in up to the PDT limit so I can start messing around with scalping. In the meantime doing tutorials and learning more about the finance side of things.
