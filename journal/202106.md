### 2021-06-21-Monday

Haven't been super consistent about working on anything, however I have continued to use the script to randomly pick stocks even after hitting the $25k PDT threshold. Though now I'm buying less per day and buying more conservatively.

I think the next immediate step should be a slight pivot...maybe I should be stepping into the Unity/C# end of this from the very beginning. Designing this as if it were a game. Ultimately I think it would be fun messing with ML-agents and this project (though probably should just learn RL directly in python in that case...).

So I'll start there. Implementing the Alpaca API in C#, and harvesting socket data from their quotes service.
